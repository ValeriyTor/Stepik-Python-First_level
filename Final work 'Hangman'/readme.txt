Description of the project: the program guesses a word, and the user has to guess it. Initially, all letters of the word are unknown. A gallows with a noose is also drawn. The user suggests a letter that can be part of this word. If there is such a letter in the word, then the program puts the letter as many times as it occurs in the word. If there is no such letter, a circle in a loop representing the head is added to the gallows. The user continues to guess the letters until the whole word is guessed. For each unsuccessful attempt, one more part of the hangman's torso is added (usually there are 6 of them: head, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs.

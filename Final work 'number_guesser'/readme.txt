Description of the program: get a random number in the detection from 1 to 100 and expect the user to guess this number.

If the guess is less than the random number, then the program should display the message 'Too small, try again'. If the user guesses the number, the program should congratulate him and display the message 'You guessed it, congratulations!'.
